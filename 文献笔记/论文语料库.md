PhaseCam3D — Learning Phase Masks for Passive Single View Depth Estimation


相关End-to-end Optimization of Optics and Algorithms 的说法：
Deep learning has now been used as a tool for end-to-end optimization of the imaging system. The key idea is to model the optical imaging formation models as parametric neural network layers, connect those layers with the application layers (i.e., image recognition, reconstruction, etc.) and finally use back-propagation to train on a large dataset to update the parameters in optics design. An earlier example is designing the optimal Bayer color filter array pattern of the image sensor [5]. More recently, [6] shows that the learned diffractive optical element achieves a good result for achromatic extended depth of field. Haim et al. [4] learned the phase mask and reconstruction algorithm for depth estimation using Deep learning. However, their framework is not entirely end-to-end, since their phase mask is learned by a separate depth classification algorithm besides the reconstruction network, and the gradient back-propagation is performed individually for each network. Such a framework limits their ability to find the optimal mask for depth estimation.
